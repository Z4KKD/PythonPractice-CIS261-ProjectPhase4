# Python Practice - CIS261 Project Phase 4

Welcome to the Python Practice - CIS261 Project Phase 4 repository! This repository contains a series of Python practice exercises and projects aimed at improving your Python programming skills. In this phase, we focus on various topics and concepts to enhance your understanding of Python.

## Topics Covered

1. **Animation**: Explore how to create simple animations using Python libraries like Pygame or Turtle Graphics.

2. **Args and Kwargs**: Understand the usage of *args and **kwargs for handling variable-length arguments in functions.

3. **Modules**: Learn how to create and use modules in Python to organize and reuse code effectively.

4. **Maps**: Practice using the `map()` function in Python to apply a function to all elements of an iterable.

5. **Reduce Functions and Walrus**: Dive into the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module and learn about the walrus operator (`:=`) introduced in Python 3.8.

6. **Zip and Filters**: Explore the `zip()` function for aggregating elements from multiple iterables and the `filter()` function for selectively filtering elements based on a condition.

7. **Mouse Events and Keybinds**: Experiment with handling mouse events and keyboard keybinds in Python applications using libraries like Pygame or Tkinter.
